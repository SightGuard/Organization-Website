## About

The Bright Path website serves as the main online presence for our organization. It provides information about our mission, projects, team, and contact details. The website is designed to be fast, responsive, and easy to maintain.

## Technologies

This project is built using the following technologies:

- [Astro](https://astro.build/): A modern frontend framework for building static websites.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SightGuard/Organization-Website
    cd Organization-Website
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

    Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (version 14 or higher). Then, run:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the development server**:

    ```bash

    This will start the Astro development server, and you can view the website at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage
